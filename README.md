To run the test succesfully you need to put files such as: base_page.py and registration_page.py into the folder called "pages". 
Then files called base_test.py and registration_test.py much be put together into folder called "tests".
Structure of folders should look like that:

folder pythonProject:
                    -folder pages:
                                base_page.py
                                registration_page.py
                    -folder tests:
                                base_test.py
                                registration_test.py
                    -locators.py
                    -run.py
